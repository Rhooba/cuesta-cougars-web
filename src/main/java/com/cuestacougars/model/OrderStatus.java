 * Represents the lifecycle states of an Order in the system.

 * Typical flow:
 * PLACED → ASSIGNED → PICKED_UP → DELIVERED
 *
 * Additional state:
 * - CANCELLED: order was terminated before completion
 *
 * Notes:
 * - State transitions are not enforced here; handled externally (Order / Driver logic)
 * - ASSIGNED occurs when a Driver is set on the Order
